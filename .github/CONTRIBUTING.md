# Contributing to MementoMind-Contextual-Web-Memory-Browser-Extension

Welcome to MementoMind! We're thrilled you're considering contributing to this project.

## 1. Our Guiding Principles

MementoMind is built upon the following core principles, inspired by FAANG-level standards and the "Managing the Unmanageable" philosophy:

*   **Zero-Defect:** Strive for the highest quality code with minimal bugs.
*   **High-Velocity:** Enable rapid iteration and development without compromising quality.
*   **Future-Proof:** Design and implement solutions that are adaptable to evolving web standards and technologies.
*   **Professional Archival:** Even retired features or versions should be documented and maintained with professional rigor.
*   **Apex Standards:** Adhere to the strictest industry best practices in architecture, testing, and documentation.

## 2. How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in many forms, including:

*   **Code Contributions:** Bug fixes, new features, performance improvements.
*   **Documentation:** Improving existing documentation, adding new guides, or clarifying complex topics.
*   **Testing:** Expanding test coverage, reporting bugs, and suggesting testing strategies.
*   **Feature Proposals:** Suggesting new features or enhancements.

## 3. Development Environment Setup

To set up your local development environment:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/chirag127/MementoMind-Contextual-Web-Memory-Browser-Extension.git
    cd MementoMind-Contextual-Web-Memory-Browser-Extension
    

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses modern web development tools. Specific commands depend on the chosen framework (e.g., npm, yarn, pnpm). Please refer to the `README.md` for detailed setup instructions.

3.  **Browser Extension Setup:**
    Instructions for loading the extension in development mode for Chrome and Firefox are available in the `README.md`.

## 4. Development Workflow

We follow a standard Git workflow:

1.  **Fork & Clone:** Create a fork of the repository and clone your fork locally.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or fix (e.g., `feature/add-new-tagging-system`, `fix/wayback-machine-url-error`).
3.  **Code & Test:** Implement your changes and ensure all tests pass. Write new tests for any new functionality.
4.  **Lint & Format:** Ensure your code adheres to the project's linting and formatting standards (e.g., using Biome or Prettier).
5.  **Commit:** Make clear, concise, and atomic commits.
6.  **Pull Request:** Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original repository.

## 5. Code Standards & Best Practices

*   **Language:** Primarily **JavaScript/TypeScript** for browser extension logic.
*   **Architecture:** Adhere to patterns like **SOLID**, **DRY**, and **YAGNI** where applicable.
*   **Linting/Formatting:** Use the configured tools (e.g., Biome, ESLint, Prettier) to maintain code quality and consistency. Run linters before committing.
*   **Testing:** All new code must be accompanied by appropriate tests (unit, integration). Aim for high code coverage.
*   **Manifest V3:** Ensure all browser extension code complies with Manifest V3 specifications.

## 6. Submission Guidelines

*   **Pull Requests:** Keep PRs focused on a single issue or feature. Provide a clear description of the changes and the problem they solve.
*   **Code Review:** Be receptive to feedback during the code review process.
*   **Issue Tracker:** Please report bugs or propose features via the GitHub Issues section.
